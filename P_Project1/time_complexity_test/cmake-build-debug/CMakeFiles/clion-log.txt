-- The C compiler identification is unknown

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  The CMAKE_C_COMPILER:

    D:/EnglishStandardPath/DevelopTools/Microsoft Visual Studio 2019C/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.28.29333/bin/Hostx86/x86/cl.exe

  is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.

  To use the NMake generator with Visual C++, cmake must be run from a shell
  that can use the compiler cl from the command line.  This environment is
  unable to invoke the cl compiler.  To fix this problem, run cmake from the
  Visual Studio Command Prompt (vcvarsall.bat).

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the full path to
  the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
